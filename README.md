# CTGAIN thesis 
THE CODE COMES WITHOUT WARRANTY

The model is now able to impute, I added a colab notebook to experiment with it. 

I must point out that the results I'm obtaining are poor in compare to other imputation models. But it isn't yet finalized.

Also, I'm working on a Pytorch 2.0 implementation, which should speed up the code a little.
